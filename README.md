"# AnkoListView" 
This is a project to orient android studio through the hurdles of gradle-plugin, anko, kotlin, and demonstrate a list widget activity built without the AS boilerplate.

the list creates propgressbars, the progressbars fill the width, unless you accidentally enclose them in another layout.  i have not yet studied what ID means in the Ankop world of dynamic UI's or how to build them properly but certain things like relativeLayout seem to crash less when the widgets have an id.

 *  built in android studio 3.0-beta-7

 * [X] concerns: gradle kotlin plugin 1.1.51 is not what is in AS. 
 * [ ]  maven port
